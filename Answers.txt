Does it work? Create a file called Answers.txt and the explanation for why this new kernel is not working as expected.

The new kernel does not work like the previous one. Here we try to spawn 6 threads which is beyond the limit of threads we have at our disposal. 
In the initialize function in tinythreads.c,  we initialize 5 threads and set the fifth threads next to point to NULL. Making the fith thread the tail of the linked list.
In the main, when we spawn the 6th thread we are trying to deqeueu an empty freeQ setting the initialized thread (newp) to NULL. When we try to execute newp->function = function;
we can't reach a function pointer since newp is NULL. This will create an error and the code will not be executed.
